# What is it?

The Hackerspace Blueprint is a living document which explains how our community works. This document is the result of more than five years of testing and improving our do-ocracy to get the best out of people. It's a system with minimal overhead and minimal control, designed to **give power to the people who do stuff**.

We've been using this system for more than five years, tweaking and improving it when we encounter issues. Interested? [Download the PDF](https://github.com/0x20/hackerspace-blueprint/releases/latest/download/hackerspace-blueprint.pdf) or [epub](https://github.com/0x20/hackerspace-blueprint/releases/latest/download/hackerspace-blueprint.epub) version to read it.

# Who are we?

We are [Hackerspace.Gent](https://hackerspace.gent) a cozy [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) in the beautiful city of [Ghent](https://visit.gent.be/en), Belgium.

# Why did we make this?

We were on the brink of collapse because of internal conflict. Instead of giving up, we decided to hack the hackerspace itself; find a system where internal conflict actually gets solved. We did an number of workshops to figure out how to do this, we wrote everything down, and got to work. Five years later, the disorganized workshop notes turned into an actual booklet. We hope you can use this to solve issues in your organization.
