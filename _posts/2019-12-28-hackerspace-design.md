We discuss how to build a thriving community and how we implement do-ocracy in our hackerspaces. 

* How to resolve interpersonal conflict.
* The value and dangers of meetings.
* How to give power to the people who do stuff.
* Rules, lack of rules and loopholes.
* How the hackerspace blueprint can help you build a better community
and much more..
